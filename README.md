# github_lab_one

# This is Github Lab 1.

# I'm just following the instructions. I should have done this earlier because now I can't even keep my eyes open.

# What I've learned from Github so far is that it's an easy and organized way to share and store code for multiple projects. It's made assignments so far easier than they might have been without it.

#Adding instructorc as a collaborator because you told me to.
